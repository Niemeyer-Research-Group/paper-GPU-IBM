@article{Peskin:1972gh,
	Abstract = {The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the $\delta$ function is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h{\textminus}1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.},

@article{Peskin:2003go,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical structure of the immersed boundary (IB) method, which is intended for the computer simulation of fluid{\textendash}structure interaction, especially in biological fluid dynamics. The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least action, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge{\textendash}Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},
